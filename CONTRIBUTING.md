# Contributing to RP Banlist Fivem Resource
The goal is to make a tool that will fulfill most of the needs banning and updating the RP Banlist System.

RP Banlist Fivem Resource is still under development, and there is a lot of features and improvements to be made.
Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated :clap:

## What kind of contributions do we need
### Issues
Issues are the feature (code level) enhancement of RP Banlist Fivem Resource. 
Feel free to file new issues for bugs, suggest feature requests or improvements and so on. Please relate the issue to an UserStory if possible.

If you wish to contribute with coding please have a look at our [Issues](https://github.com/Sanden-Utvikling/rp-banlist-fivem-resource/issues).
Issues that are in the TODO column should be ready to go, assign it to yourself and start working on it :computer:
Especially the ones labeled as a `good first issue` might be a good start. 
Other issues might need some discussion or clarification before it can be started on, give us your thoughts or suggestions on something you would like to work on, and we can take it from there :smiley: 

## Contribution process
We use a [fork and pull request workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr). Fork the repo, and get going!

Templates for both issues and pull requests are used. They both provide a check list that indicates what we hope to see present.
Not all checkpoints will be applicable for all issues/PRs, but checking of as many boxes as possible is a good start.

When a PR is opened, a CI job will be run to verify that everything is linted properly.

After the CI job is passed, a review will be done. A maintainer will merge the PR when all is good :thumbsup:

## Set up development environment
It is recommended to clone this into a test Fivem Server under the resources folder.

```
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:<yourgithubaccount>/rp-banlist-fivem-resource.git
